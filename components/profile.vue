          potential in real situations and that's fine by me, for how big my

        ~ Before highschool (till 2016) - Born in Agadir on may 13th of 1999, I
        have always managed to get myself amazed by any technology I came
        across. Playing with electronics as a child, coding mini games in early
        teenage years, enrolling to mechanic studies in highschool...
        <br />
        ~ Baccalaureate (2017) - When I got my baccalaureate in mechanical techs
        and sciences, it seemed like I was destined to take a step back and
        study many more technical, scientific and litterary domains.
        <br />
        ~ Preparatory classes (2017-2019) - I spent the next two years in
        preparatory classes for engineering schools - industrial technologies
        and sciences branch (CPGE TSI). Once done with all of the orientation
        and school acceptance contests, I was more than happy to join the
        Littoral CÃ´te d'Opale's engineering school of information technologies,
        with which I still am today.
        <br />
        ~ Engineering school (since 2019) - This leads us to the main purpose of
        this website I made while personally practicing web development: I'm
        still looking for an internship with some company that wants some
        profile in computer science near mine, and with whom I'd learn about
        real workspaces organisation and methods.
